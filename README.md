# What is this repository for?

This repository contains a dataset of 2D Magnetic Resonance Images (`dataset/` folder). The data for each image is stored in the subfolder `im_$N`, where `$N` is a number. Each folder contains the following images, visible as `.png` and also serialized to as `.npy` and `.pt` to ease their integration into your [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based projects:

- The ground-truth image (`gt`).
- A binary mask (`mask`) highlighting the region of interest of the image, automatically generated by the [Neural Pre-processing](https://github.com/Novestars/Neural_Pre_Processing) software package.
- The Rician noise-contamined ground-truth images for different strengths of noise, $\Sigma = \{0.05,0.10,...,0.40\}$. Each such image is named `Std$S`, where `$S`$\in\Sigma$.

The repository also contains two simple codes inside the `src/`. They are not strictly necessary. They have been uploaded in the hopes that they may be useful:

- `contaminate.py`, which by default considers all ground-truth images, contaminates them with Rician noise and prints and serializes them to `.pt`. We use our [image-utils](https://github.com/heqro/image-utils) repository.
- `pt_to_npy.py`, which is a simple converter between `.pt` to `.npy` files.

# How do I use it?

Provided you **only** want to work with the dataset we provide, just add it as a submodule of your `git` project:
```
git submodule add git@github.com:heqro/brains-to-denoise.git datasets/
```

You may ensure your submodule is up-to-date by executing the following command:
```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

However, if you want to **generate additional** noisy images by using any of the scripts we provide, you may prefer to clone the repository and grab the [image-utils](https://github.com/heqro/image-utils) submodule:

```
git clone git@github.com:heqro/brains-to-denoise.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
